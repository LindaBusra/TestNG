       • This is a very popular Framework Design Pattern.

       • When we have a lot of tests in our test suits, it gets more complex to maintain
    our test cases and codes to have a better framework design that is
    maintainable, reusable, faster, understandable.
        • With page object model, we keep page specific elements or methods on page
    classes, and keep them away from the actual test classes.
        • We will basically create page classes, and test classes using core Java and
    Selenium concept to increase the efficiency of our framework.

    • Maintaining Automation framework (part of stlc) may be challenging over the time as we build the test cases and
    codes.

    • When a functionality of an application changes, we have to check our framework to fix the code. Then debugging
    needed.

    • Easy to debugging(try to understand what is the problem) test scripts.

    • Page Object Design is an automation framework design for testing applications to reduce the challenges.

    • Page Object Design make it possible to reuse the objects, classes, methods, data, etc. So testers do less work. Create
    once and use multiple times.

    • A better design makes the test execution time faster.

    • Not all companies use page object model design, but everyone knows about it, and it is getting more popular.


Page Class:
Create page elements and/or major methods
•Test Class:
Call page objects
Create test cases and assertion
